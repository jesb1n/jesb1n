# Hello ðŸ‘‹
Being a final-year B.Tech CSE student, I am interested in open-source technologies such as Linux and Docker. I am enthusiastic in learning new technology and hope to improve my communication abilities. I also have expertise in documentation, blogging, and other similar fields. With a strong desire to learn, I am confident in my ability to contribute to any team.
